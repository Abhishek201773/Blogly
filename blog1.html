            One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River Yamuna in Agra. It was
            built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses
            the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal
            is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire
            population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument.

            Popularly known as a biker's paradise, Leh is one of the two capitals of Ladakh that has numerous passes
            linking various locations in the challenging terrain. The city is nestled in a valley at an elevation of
            around 3,520 m in the upper Indus River, enveloped by the colossal peaks of the Ladakh Range. Regardless
            of its harsh weather and difficult accessibility, Leh was once an essential stopover for vital trade
            routes that connected Tibet to the East, Kashmir to the West and India to China. Today, Leh is the best
            Himalayan town to find untouched natural beauty

            Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates to the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along the fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids and Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and Valley of the Kings tombs. The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman landmarks like Muhammad Ali Mosque and the Egyptian Museum, a trove of antiquities. ― Google</p>
